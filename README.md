# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms practice programs**, written primarily in **Java**.  
It reflects my consistent problem-solving practice, logical thinking, and understanding of core DSA concepts.

## 🖥️ Input and Output Handling (VS Code)

For convenience during practice, I use a simple input/output setup in
**Visual Studio Code** to test programs efficiently.

- `input.txt`  
  Used to provide input data to the currently running program.

- `output.txt`  
  Stores the output generated by the program for easy verification.
  which is present outside of all folders or I can say in root folder
  
## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Strengthen **problem-solving and logical reasoning**
- Build a strong foundation for **technical interviews**
- Prepare for **coding assessments and placements**
